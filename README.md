# Backstory
So, I got a bit into Dominion this summer. Despite enjoying the game, I couldn't really justify spending all my time playing it, especially by myself. That's when I thought of the only reasonable course of action: recreate the entire game in c++ so I can play against bots and justify the time spent by having improved at programming. ðŸ¤“

# Compilation
Here's how to clone the repo, compile the program and run it. WSL or Linux is recommended. You can replace g++ with any compiler of your choice. Enter the following commands into bash:

git clone https://github.com/budjetti/dominion\
cd dominion\
g++ dominion.cpp -o dominion\
./dominion\
