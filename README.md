# Overview
This is a command-line adaptation of base game Dominion (2008). Features bots with rudimentary strategy who love to attack. If you have a c++ development environment ready, the following commands should be enough to compile and run the project. You can replace g++ with any compiler of your choice.

git clone https://github.com/budjetti/dominion  
cd dominion  
g++ dominion.cpp -o dominion  
./dominion  

# Backstory
So, I got a bit into Dominion this summer. Despite enjoying it, I couldn't really justify spending much time playing it, especially by myself. That's when I thought of the only reasonable thing to do: recreate the entire game in c++ so I can play against bots and justify the time spent by having improved at programming. ðŸ¤“
